        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Learn how to make steamed red bean buns starting from scratch.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of red beans</li>
            <li>5 cups of water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of instant yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Wash the red beans thoroughly before tranferring into a cooker.</li>
            <li>Add in 3 cups of water and cook for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and vanilla extract into the rice cooker. Keep stirring until the water is fully absorbed by the red beans. This might take up to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Set aside and wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, 2 cups of lukewarm water, and yeast in an electric mixer until it forms a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Knead for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough into a bowl and cover with cling wrap. Wait for an hour until the dough has risen to twice of its original size.</li>
            <li>Add the cooled red bean compote into a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add more flour on the surface of the dough and knead the dough into balls bigger than your palms.</li>
            <li>Flatten each ball and place some red bean paste into the middle of the dough. Slowly stretch and seal the dough around the red bean paste.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough under a wet towel for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Add parchment paper into a steamer and place the buns inside. Steam for about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat for 1-2 minutes and the steamed buns are ready.</li>
        </ol>
